### What I learned

  This is the second project on the road to getting consistent and better at front-end development. 
  I would like to do at least one project a week, but with my current school and work schedule that might be a little difficult to manage.
  I really liked this project. The way it looks and how it got me back into testing my knowledge of css.
  I tried to give it a little more depth with the transitions between active states which I think gives a nice touch to the project.
  I also just noticed that there is an extra challenges on frontendmentor, in this case with the font size on modile, but I gave up on it because I had no clue how to do it.

### Continued development

For the next project I want to go bigger. This includes some responsiveness with js again.
But these few projects that I've done are quite small. Just individual cards.
I also want to go work on the extra challenges, get to know the ins and outs of css.
It may also be good to look into making it look good on mobile screen sizes. I didn't do that too much for my previous projects.
I would also like to start doing the junior projects and learn React but that won't be for the next project.
